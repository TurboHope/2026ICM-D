HOW TO USE THE DATA FOR MCM PROJECT
================================================================================

1. NETWORK ANALYSIS (Primary Focus)
   ----------------------------------
   File: 1_lineup_network_edges.csv

   Build a player interaction network:
   - Nodes = Players (572 players)
   - Edges = Time played together (2902 connections)
   - Edge weight = Minutes_Together
   - Edge attribute = Net_Rating (performance metric)

   Analysis you can do:
   a) Centrality Metrics
      - Betweenness centrality: Find "connector" players
      - Degree centrality: Players with most teammates
      - Eigenvector centrality: Players connected to important players

   b) Community Detection
      - Identify tight-knit player groups
      - Reveal team chemistry clusters

   c) Optimal Lineup Prediction
      - Use Net_Rating to find best player combinations
      - Predict performance of untested lineups

   Example Python code:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import networkx as nx

   edges = pd.read_csv('data/1_lineup_network_edges.csv')
   G = nx.Graph()

   for _, row in edges.iterrows():
       G.add_edge(row['Player_A'], row['Player_B'],
                  weight=row['Minutes_Together'],
                  net_rating=row['Net_Rating'])

   # Find most central players
   centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G, weight='weight')
   top_players = sorted(centrality.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:10]
   ```


2. PLAYER PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
   ---------------------------
   Files: 1_player_basic_stats.csv + 1_player_advanced_stats_nba_api.csv

   Merge datasets on 'Player' column:
   - Calculate efficiency metrics (points per minute, etc.)
   - Identify undervalued players
   - Performance clustering

   Once you add salary data:
   - Value per dollar analysis
   - Contract efficiency rankings


3. MARKET EXPANSION ANALYSIS
   --------------------------
   File: 3_city_market_data.csv

   Use for:
   - Identifying cities for potential new NBA teams
   - Market size analysis (population, GDP)
   - Geographic distribution optimization

   Combine with Google Trends data (when collected):
   - Measure fan interest by region
   - Predict revenue potential


4. MERGING ALL DATASETS
   ---------------------
   After collecting remaining data, run:

   ```bash
   python merge_datasets.py
   ```

   This creates:
   - MASTER_player_complete.csv (all player data merged)
   - MASTER_player_network_metrics.csv (network centrality scores)
   - MASTER_team_data.csv (team-level data)


NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Ready to use now):
 1. Start network analysis with 1_lineup_network_edges.csv
 2. Explore player stats (basic + advanced)
 3. Analyze lineup performance patterns

SHORT-TERM (Manual data collection needed):
 4. Visit Spotrac.com to get salary data
 5. Visit Forbes.com for team valuations
 6. Retry Google Trends (wait for rate limit to reset)
 7. Get social media data from Social Blade

FINAL STEPS:
 8. Run merge_datasets.py to create master files
 9. Build mathematical models for MCM competition
10. Create visualizations and analysis
